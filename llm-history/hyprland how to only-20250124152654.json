[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful chinese assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "hyprland how to only active in default monitor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Hyprland, if you want to ensure that a specific workspace or application only appears on the default monitor, you can achieve this by configuring the monitor and workspace settings in your Hyprland configuration file (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`).\n\nHere’s how you can set it up:\n\n### 1. Identify Your Default Monitor\nFirst, you need to identify which monitor is your default monitor. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nhyprctl monitors\n```\n\nThis will list all connected monitors along with their names and other details. Note the name of the monitor you want to set as the default.\n\n### 2. Configure the Monitor in `hyprland.conf`\nOpen your `hyprland.conf` file and define the default monitor. For example:\n\n```bash\nmonitor=DP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1\n```\n\nHere, `DP-1` is the name of the monitor, `1920x1080@144` is the resolution and refresh rate, `0x0` is the position, and `1` is the scale factor.\n\n### 3. Bind Workspaces to the Default Monitor\nYou can bind specific workspaces to the default monitor. For example:\n\n```bash\nworkspace=1, monitor:DP-1\nworkspace=2, monitor:DP-1\nworkspace=3, monitor:DP-1\n```\n\nThis will ensure that workspaces 1, 2, and 3 are always displayed on the default monitor (`DP-1` in this case).\n\n### 4. Launch Applications on the Default Monitor\nIf you want specific applications to always open on the default monitor, you can use the `exec` command with the `--monitor` flag. For example:\n\n```bash\nexec-once=alacritty --monitor DP-1\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the `alacritty` terminal always opens on the default monitor.\n\n### 5. Restrict Applications to the Default Monitor\nYou can also use window rules to restrict certain applications to the default monitor. For example:\n\n```bash\nwindowrule=monitor DP-1,^(firefox)$\n```\n\nThis rule ensures that Firefox always opens on the default monitor (`DP-1`).\n\n### 6. Reload Hyprland Configuration\nAfter making these changes, reload your Hyprland configuration to apply them:\n\n```bash\nhyprctl reload\n```\n\n### Example Configuration\nHere’s an example snippet from a `hyprland.conf` file:\n\n```bash\n# Define the default monitor\nmonitor=DP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1\n\n# Bind workspaces to the default monitor\nworkspace=1, monitor:DP-1\nworkspace=2, monitor:DP-1\nworkspace=3, monitor:DP-1\n\n# Launch applications on the default monitor\nexec-once=alacritty --monitor DP-1\n\n# Restrict applications to the default monitor\nwindowrule=monitor DP-1,^(firefox)$\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that the specified workspaces and applications are only active on the default monitor.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy configuring your `hyprland.conf` file with the appropriate monitor and workspace settings, you can control which monitor specific workspaces and applications appear on. This allows you to ensure that certain activities are confined to your default monitor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "hyprland how to disable monitor"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Hyprland, if you want to disable a monitor, you can do so by configuring the monitor settings in your `hyprland.conf` file. Disabling a monitor essentially means that Hyprland will no longer use that monitor for displaying workspaces or applications.\n\nHere’s how you can disable a monitor:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify the Monitor Name\nFirst, identify the name of the monitor you want to disable. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nhyprctl monitors\n```\n\nThis will list all connected monitors along with their names, resolutions, and other details. Note the name of the monitor you want to disable (e.g., `HDMI-A-1`, `DP-1`, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Disable the Monitor in `hyprland.conf`\nOpen your `hyprland.conf` file (usually located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`) and add a line to disable the monitor. Use the `monitor` keyword with the `disable` option.\n\nFor example, to disable a monitor named `HDMI-A-1`, add the following line:\n\n```bash\nmonitor=HDMI-A-1,disable\n```\n\nThis tells Hyprland to ignore the monitor and not use it for any display output.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Reload Hyprland Configuration\nAfter making the change, reload your Hyprland configuration to apply the new settings:\n\n```bash\nhyprctl reload\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Verify the Monitor is Disabled\nRun the `hyprctl monitors` command again to verify that the monitor has been disabled. The disabled monitor should no longer appear in the list.\n\n---\n\n### Example Configuration\nHere’s an example of what your `hyprland.conf` might look like if you want to disable a monitor named `HDMI-A-1`:\n\n```bash\n# Disable HDMI-A-1 monitor\nmonitor=HDMI-A-1,disable\n\n# Configure other monitors\nmonitor=DP-1,1920x1080@144,0x0,1\nmonitor=eDP-1,1366x768@60,1920x0,1\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- If you want to re-enable the monitor later, simply remove or comment out the `monitor=HDMI-A-1,disable` line and reload the configuration.\n- If you have workspaces or applications bound to the disabled monitor, they will automatically move to the remaining active monitors.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Temporarily Disable a Monitor\nIf you want to temporarily disable a monitor without editing the configuration file, you can use the `hyprctl` command:\n\n```bash\nhyprctl keyword monitor HDMI-A-1,disable\n```\n\nThis will disable the monitor immediately, but the change will not persist after a restart. To make it permanent, you still need to add the line to your `hyprland.conf`.\n\n---\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily disable a monitor"}]
